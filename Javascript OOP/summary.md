Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that utilizes the concept of "objects" to organize and structure code. OOP principles can be summarized as follows:

1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (properties) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit known as an object. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world and restricting direct access to some of an object's components.

2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most relevant level of inheritance for a particular aspect of the problem. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass/base class). This promotes code reusability, as common attributes and behaviors can be defined in a superclass and inherited by multiple subclasses.

4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables objects of different classes to be manipulated through a common interface. Polymorphism is often expressed as "one interface, many implementations," meaning that different classes can be used interchangeably if they implement the same interface.
In summary, Object-Oriented Programming is about organizing code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior, abstracting away complexities, enabling inheritance for code reuse, and allowing polymorphism for flexible usage of objects. These principles contribute to code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
